## Intro

This is the GitHub page for the code for the freeCodeCamp Accra website.

This is where it is, for now: [silly-porter.surge.sh](silly-porter.surge.sh)


## Ways You Can Help

#### Non-Coders

* Please feel free to suggest any edits or improvements of the site, concerning the design.

#### Coders

_Things the Site Is Missing_

* A Sign-In Page: For all that come to Coffee-and-Code, it would be very convenient to have a form on the website, where they can fill in details, like their name, phone number (for addition to the WhatsApp group), and freeCodeCamp username. (Difficulty: Easy/Intermediate) <br><br>
* A Gallery Page/Upload Process: Every Saturday, at the end of Coffee-and-Code, we take a picture of those who attened. It would nice to have a gallery page on the site (Difficulty: Easy/Intermediate) <br><br>
* (Critical) There is a way to scrape the freeCodeCamp website, enabling you to get a list of the challenges a user has completed. For freeCodeCamp Accra members who sign up on a form on our website, the goal is to create a page that shows the top 10 members each week in terms of challenges completed. The code is nearly finished, just needs a little push to get there (Difficulty: Intermediate)


_Fixing the Site Needs_

* There's been an attempt to create a very rudimentary JavaScript router. It doesn't work fully. React Router is the best bet here, and refactoring to use React Router from the version @meyian wrote would be very cool... (Difficulty: Intermediate/Advanced) <br><br>

* The site hasn't been throughly tested to be mobile device friendly. Ensuring that the website looks good on a mobile device is a key goal for us, down the line. (Difficulty: Intermediate/Advanced)
